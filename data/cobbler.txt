A cobbler named Ethan lived in a small, bustling town. His workshop was modest,\n","    tucked into a quiet alley, but people from all over visited him to have their\n","    shoes repaired. Ethan was meticulous and humble, never charging more than what was fair.\n","\n","    One day, an elderly man with tattered shoes came to his shop. “Fix these for me,” the\n","    man said, placing the worn-out pair on the counter. Ethan noticed something odd—the\n","    shoes weren’t just old; they were beyond repair. Yet, the man smiled with hope.\n","\n","    Ethan hesitated but decided to try. For hours, he carefully stitched and glued,\n","    his hands aching by the time he finished. When the man returned, Ethan handed over\n","    the pair, polished and sturdy. The man examined them closely, nodded, and said,\n","    “You’ve done well.”\n","\n","    To Ethan’s surprise, the man didn’t pay. Instead, he left behind a single golden thread.\n","    Confused, Ethan tucked it into his drawer and thought little of it.\n","\n","    Days turned into weeks. Strangely, Ethan noticed something remarkable: no matter\n","    how many shoes he fixed or how many customers he served, his supplies never ran out.\n","    The thread, he realized, was magical, subtly replenishing his shop.\n","\n","    Yet, it worked only as long as Ethan continued his craft with care and sincerity.\n","\n","    The cobbler understood the lesson. True abundance isn’t in what we receive but in the\n","    quiet, honest effort we put into our work.
